# Telcom Customer Churn Prediction App

## Overview
Welcome to the Telcom Customer Churn Prediction App project! This application is crafted to predict when telecom customers may leave, helping to prevent churn through targeted interventions. Leveraging a range of data analytics and machine learning techniques, our application dives deep into customer behaviors to understand and predict churn with precision.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Streamlined processing to clean and prep data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visual and statistical analyses to discover trends and patterns in the data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizing powerful machine learning models to predict churn probabilities.
- **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous testing to ensure our models perform well in varied scenarios.

## Technologies
This project is built using:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries such as Pandas for data management, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for modeling.
